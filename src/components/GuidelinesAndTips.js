									with the contractor or workers. Keep track
									of any keys given out. If you give an opener
									or security door code, create a temporary
									code while the work is in progress. Once the
									work is complete, return to your regular
									code. Don't forget to ask who will take

									ordered matches the product that was
									delivered to your home- and don't just trust
									the box it came in. Open it!
