						existing home. Add some bedroom(s), bathroom(s), laundry
						, perhaps an home office or entertainment space! we have
						the ability to assess your existing structure to see if
						it needs reinforcing for a second floor or maybe you have
						a cape where we just add walls and a roof system. Adding
						a second floor is one of the best ways to add excellent
						extra value.
